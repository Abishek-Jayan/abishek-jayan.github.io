# about me
first-paragraph: I am a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience, currently working at QBurst Technologies, Trivandrum.
second-paragraph: I've lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trivandrum, India </a>all my life, having done my undergrad at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Trivandrum and my schooling at Loyola School, Trivandrum.
research-interest: I have done research in Machine Learning, having authored two papers related to Supervised Machine Learning.
# first-paragraph: I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Arlington</a> and a research assistant at the <hightlight>Learning and Adaptive Robotics Lab</hightlight>, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=huber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Manfred Huber</a>. (‚óï‚ñø‚óï)
# second-paragraph: I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saigon, Vietnam</a>, and was fortunate to spend my most memorable time at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU-HCM_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted</a> (informatics program of 2020) and previously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A7n_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i_Ngh%C4%A9a_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TƒêN Secondary School for the Gifted</a> (mathematics program of 2017) with very good friends - too many to name them here, where we played football (soccer) on concrete fields together afterschool.
# research-interest: I do research in robotics, mainly focusing on applying <b>cognitive architectures to robotic grasping</b> to enable robots with a closely similar human grasping capability. Just imagine the robot enters the kitchen, finds a banana, grasps without crushing it, and brings it back to you.
